# What is a Userscript?

A userscript is a program, usually written in JavaScript, designed to modify web pages to enhance browsing. Userscripts can be enabled on browsers such as Firefox or Google Chrome through userscript manager browser extensions like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it), [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

Instead, consider using [Enhancer for YouTube](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube) for a better experience.
