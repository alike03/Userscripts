# Youtube Docking

## [Install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alike03/Userscripts/master/src/YouTubeDocking.user.js)

## Description

With this script, you can read the comments while watching the video. When you start scrolling down, as soon as the player leaves the visible area, the player moves to the bottom right corner. Just like the Youtube Mini player. But in this case you can modify the player size by editing the file.

If there is anything you want to see. Feel free to ask about it.
